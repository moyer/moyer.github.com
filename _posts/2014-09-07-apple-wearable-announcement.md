title: Thoughts About The Apple Wearable
---

- The device won't be focused on interaction. If it has a screen, it'll be for alerts and displaying small bits of information. If there is any interaction, it'll be minimal, like dismissing a notification. I doubt you'll be tapping out [text messages on your wrist](http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/hands-on-with-the-samsung-gear-s-smart-watch/). A lot of touching and tapping and talking to your wrist doesn't make for a good user experience. Plus, current battery technology puts some [serious constraints](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/09/05/apples-juice) on that kind of thing. I'll be very surprised if it's anything like the phone-on-your-wrist concept below.

- I wouldn't be surprised if there were models that didn't have a screen at all.

- The idea is not a standalone device -- that would replace an existing Apple product -- but a complimentary device that would work in tandem with existing Apple products. This isn't a situation like the iPad, which to (some degree) could cannibalize Mac sales, or the iPhone, which cannibalized the original iPod. Unless you're doing some kind of content creation, you can go for weeks without using a laptop. The iPhone and iPad subsumed so many tasks were previously done on computers (checking email, browsing the web, watching movies, gaming, messaging, and even some desktop publishing) but I can't imagine a tiny screen on your wrist being disruptive in the same way. It'll have to compliment those existing devices. At least for now.

- The device will be focused on identity. [Imagine picking up an iPhone and having it unlock because you're wearing your Apple wristband](http://cl.ly/XPfz). Or turning on your Apple TV and having your custom profile loaded because you're wearing your Apple watch. The same goes for signing into your Mac.

- Identity is completely in-line with increased continuity between devices. Your devices all working together is a huge part of [OS X Yosemite and iOS 8](https://www.apple.com/osx/preview/mac-and-ios/). You'll be able to answer phone calls and SMS messages on your Mac and hand off documents between iOS and your computer. I think a wearable is the logical tool for enabling you to seamlessly move between all your Apple devices. It's like your Apple id or iCloud account, only it exists on your wrist.

- Imagine a future where all your data is stored on the cloud and every device is simply a terminal that accesses that data. You can sit down on any Mac in the world or pick up any iOS device and because you're wearing some kind of identifying device, it'll instantly be tailored and personalized for you. You'd see your homescreen and your apps. Your documents would be there. Obviously that's a long way off -- and creates all kinds of data security issues -- but I think the wearable is a step in that direction.

- Speaking of security, a wearable built for identity is a pretty good additional factor for multi-factor authentication. And it's convenient enough to not add an unacceptable amount of friction to an average user's life. (Also, maybe vibrating alerts when you get too far from your device, so your wristband will help prevent you from losing your phone.)

- A wearable centered around identity also meshes well with fashion. Fashion is a statement of personality. An Apple wristband/watch would say "this is who I am" both in functionality and form. It would have to respect that aspect of fashion to be viable anyway, since that is a dominant reason people wear things. (It's also in-line with how Apple treats its other products. Like it or not, they're statements about taste as much as anything else.) Expect [classy watch models](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/09/marc-newson-apple-jony-ive), at least eventually. Maybe something closer to this:

- It'll have all the cool sensors that Fitbit and the Nike Fuelband had. Movement tracking and silent alarms and sleep measurement and everything else, all with better integration into your phone. (I wore a Fitbit for those features alone, without an interactive screen or it being particularly fashionable.) Roll in the identity stuff and some stylish designs and you have a pretty compelling product.

- [You probably won't be able to get one until next year.](http://recode.net/2014/08/29/codered-apple-wearable-wont-ship-until-next-year/)
