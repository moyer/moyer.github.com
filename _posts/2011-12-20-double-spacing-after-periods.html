<p>A friend asked me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are you a one- or two-space after the period kinda guy? I&#8217;ve always been a two-fer but only because that&#8217;s what habit they forced on me as a kid. Now I&#8217;m hearing and agreeing with arguments for the one-er, but its a tough habit to break. Thoughts?</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a two part nerdy explanation, just because I love talking about this sort of thing.</p>
<h2>Semantic Argument</h2>
<p>Spacing between words or sentences or paragraphs or whatever is a presentational decision. It should be kept separate from content.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re typing and you hit the spacebar, you&#8217;re adding in some content. A space counts as content. The size of that space, though, is a design decision. Just like the size of a letter is a design decision. By entering two spaces, you&#8217;re actually adding more content with the aim of changing the presentation.</p>
<p>Obviously, this single instance isn&#8217;t that big of a deal. But the issue of separation of content and style is a big one on the web (and digital communication) and it&#8217;s a good habit to foster.</p>
<p>Even in something like Word, it&#8217;s better to rely on its styling presets, rather than add content to your text to try to adjust the look.</p>
<p>For example, changing the setting to increase the size between lines is far more preferable than manually adding a hard return at the end of every line. Why? Because the hard return becomes part of the content. This makes it a bitch to change it in the future. If you want the presentation to be different, you end up having to go in and edit out a bunch of content. It makes the content less transferable too. Who knows how it&#8217;ll look when you paste it into an email?</p>
<p>The same goes for spacing between letters, words, and sentences. Leave the style decisions separate from the content. Let a designer make them, or choose from software presets, or rely on the spacing defaults included in digital fonts. Don&#8217;t muck up your beautifully written content.</p>
<h2>Typographic Argument</h2>
<p>From a typographic standpoint, extra space after a full stop is usually disruptive to the flow of text. A lot of the readability of text relies on consistent rhythm and flow, both vertically and horizontally.</p>
<p>Even if readers aren&#8217;t conscious of this, it makes text less enjoyable to read and causes more eye strain when things disrupt this flow.</p>
<p>When you set an optimal measure (typically a paragraph width of 45 to 75 characters) the text naturally fills it in with an appropriate rhythm. A well designed font will have the proper sizes and spaces so that the text will look beautiful and be easy to read. Extra spacing between words – especially if it isn&#8217;t consistent, like only adding in extra spacing after periods – disrupts this flow. It makes text more jarring and clunky and harder for a person&#8217;s eyes to follow.</p>
<p>Typographers like to gauge the “color” of a body of text. If you look at text block from far away, or while squinting, well set text will kind of blur into a solid gray block with even “color” throughout. Random extra spacing disrupts this nice even color, causing ugly gaps that reader&#8217;s eyes will stumble over.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Hope this helps explain things.</p>
