I wrote a book. It's called [*Writing For The Web*](http://writingfortheweb.co). It's a short guide for bloggers, journalists, copywriters, authors, and anybody else who writes.

I'm a writer myself, and I've been working with writers for years. During university, I was editor-in-chief of a student run magazine. After graduating, I worked for a journalism non-profit for a year and a half.  And while freelancing in Asia, I've been working closely with bloggers, copywriters, and authors. At the same time that I've been surrounded with writers, I've also been surrounded by developers.

If you're a writer, this might be a surprise to you, but developers have way better tools for writing than you do. Way, *way* better. Most writers I meet are still stuck in the old ways of writing. They're stuck using word processors — usually Microsoft Word — which are better suited for the print age than for the digital age. They're stuck emailing attachments to their editors and clients.

What kind of versioning systems do most writers use? It's either a folder full of files named `article_08_2013_Jakes_edit_2_FINAL.doc` or Word's built-in Track Changes function. Track Changes -- without hyperbole -- is a nightmare. And ever escalating duplicate files with cryptic naming conventions (`second_draft_V3_FINAL.doc`? what?) might be even worse. But writers don't know what else to do.

At some point in the 1990's, Microsoft Word became the defacto for standard for writing. In the minds of many, it's still the only to way to write. There are alternatives such as Google Docs or Apple's Pages, but they still follow the same basic word processor formula. The *real* alternatives seem too technical or too obscure for most people to consider. But they're not.

There are amazing alternatives to using Microsoft Word. There are tools that make it a delight to compose, that make sharing and collaborating easy, that make your content far more accessible and future proof than any word processor ever could.

*Writing For The Web* introduces these tools to writers. It explains the concepts behind them and gives examples of how you can use them to build robust workflows that perfectly fit your needs. Do you need to be a developer? Do you need to know how to code or have a technical background? Not at all. This book is all about introducing writers to the tools they deserve, tools that will make them far happier and more productive.

The book hasn't been released yet. I'm still prepping it for sale on Amazon and it'll be available on Kindle soon. And, depending on the response, print versions may follow.

If you're a writer who feels stuck with the frustrations of Microsoft Word and emailing documents, this book will change the way you write.
