The amazing Hannah Braime, who is a friend and client of mine, interviewed me last week on her podcast. Hannah runs [Becoming Who You Are](http://www.becomingwhoyouare.net/), a personal development site with *tons* of resources. (I especially recommend her book on [journaling](http://www.becomingwhoyouare.net/tools/the-ultimate-guide-to-journaling/).)

Hannah and I talked about what it is like to live and work abroad, including the struggle of uprooting your life and frustrations of living in a foreign country. There's also some encouragement in there for those of you interested in being location independent. 

You can listen to the [episode](http://www.becomingwhoyouare.net/2013/02/episode-016-living-and-working-abroad-interview-with-will-moyer/) on her site or [download](http://media.blubrry.com/bwya/p/www.becomingwhoyouare.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/016_Working_and_Living_Abroad_an_Interview_with_Will_Moyer.mp3) the mp3 directly.
