My first article on Medium, "[There's Only One Kind Of Medicine](https://medium.com/editors-picks/64a37ea9d0ee)." You can follow that link for the full text, but here are some excerpts:

> Why is there this tendency to defend and excuse (if not outright praise) traditional and alternative medicine? A bizarre cultural relativism underlies the way Westerners frequently talk about these forms of medicine. *Who are we to say that a culture’s beliefs are wrong? Who are we to say the way they practice medicine is inferior?*

> I understand the desire to respect and be sensitive to cultures, but cultural practices don’t change reality.

> One would hope this isn’t necessary to point out, but it probably is: the human body is a part of physical reality. The way it responds to chemical substances, the way pathogens affect it, and the way physical trauma harms it are not subject to personal or cultural beliefs. No more than any other chemical or physical reaction is subject to belief or opinion. Nor is an African body or a European body different because of the culture they exist in. They may be different because of genetic reasons or because of environmental effects, but these have nothing to do with religious, cultural, or traditional beliefs.

> None of this is to defend what we inaccurately label “Western medicine.” Western doctors make mistakes, they can be stubborn or ignorant, Western studies have methodological errors, and pharmaceutical companies may push harmful drugs for short-term profits. It is, in fact, these very apparent shortcomings of medicine in the Western world that likely drives people to embrace alternative medicine.

> The debate is not between “Western medicine” and traditional medicine, it’s between methodological, evidence-based medicine and *everything else*. As the title says, there is only one kind of medicine.
