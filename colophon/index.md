This is the fourth version of WillMoyer.com.

It is set in [Adobe's Source Sans](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [Abril Fatface](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Abril+Fatface). They are both available under the Open Font License.

Almost all the content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

This site was handcoded (with love) in Sublime Text 2 on a MacBook Pro 15-inch with Retina display. It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). All of the source code is viewable in a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/moyer/moyer.github.com).
