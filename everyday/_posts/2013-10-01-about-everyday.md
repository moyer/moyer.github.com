Everyday is a blog where I post something every single day. It's inspired by similar projects like [Mike Winkelmann's Everydays](http://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays.php), [Joshua DuChene's Create Every Day](http://www.skeeterskinwalker.com/create-every-day/), and [Cesar Kuriyama's One Second Every Day](http://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day.html). 

I want to write more. I want to be a better writer. And I know that in order to do that, I have to increase my output. 

When I have an idea or opinion to share, the easiest, low-friction place to share it is Twitter. But Twitter doesn't work for writing anything substantial. And sometimes it [kills my motivation](http://dcurt.is/what-i-would-have-written) to flesh out my ideas. My only other option is to write an article.

Articles, though, are hard to produce quickly. Writing articles is a high-friction process. It takes time and effort. There are quality and length standards I have for my articles. I typically have a friend or two look over them before publishing. And there are psychological barriers that prevent me from just tapping out a few paragraphs and then calling it an "article." I just can't do it. It doesn't feel right.

I need a place where it's okay to go for quantity over quality. I need a place where I can just focus on output, on getting my thoughts out there quickly, without letting my internal editor stress out over whether or not the content is "good enough."

Everyday is that place.
