title: Writing At Night

I'm typically more productive at night. It's when I get a lot of my design work done. But since starting to write every day, I've discovered that writing at night sucks. Maybe it's because writing is not a regular process for me and after a few weeks of pratice, I'd be able to write at night like a pro. But right now it's really hard.

You know that feeling where you feel like you can't think? That's what is happening here. So, if you think this post sucks, it's because I'm writing it at night.
