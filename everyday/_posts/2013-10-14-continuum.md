With *Breaking Bad* over and *Game of Thrones* between seasons, I've been searching for some new television storytelling that can fill the void. *Continuum* is one of the new shows receiving recommendations, so I watched the first season (of two) and decided to review it.

The show starts off in Vancouver in 2077 and follows Kiera Cameron, played by [Rachel Nichols](http://cl.ly/0F1Y0L1O2D2T), who is a City Protective Services officer (basically a future cop). Vancouver is part of the "North American Union" which appears to be a highly advanced police state run by a corporate congress with a man named Alec Sadler at the top.

The central conflict revolves around a group called "Liber8" that is challenging the corporation-run government. In the pilot episode, Liber8 bombs a building and eight of their members are sentenced to death. They escape execution by using a time travel device which transports them, Cameron, and others back to 2012.

From there, the standard episode format has Cameron working with the 2012 Vancouver police and a young Alec Sadler to stop the Liber8 members from altering the future.

## The Good

*Continuum* is at its best when dealing with social and ethical questions. Like most good sci-fi, the fictional elements are there to raise questions about non-fictional human issues.

There's a lot of gray in Continuum. Is the future, with a government run by corporations, actually a good place? Is it dystopian? The protagonist of the show is defending it, but maybe she's just been propagandized. On the other hand, Liber8 behaves like terrorists, so it's hard to root for them. (Although, members and associates of Liber8 do differ on their strategy; some want a more peaceful hearts-and-minds approach.) Even if Liber8 is on the right side, is using violence as a means to a better future justifiable?

Technological issues are also present. Are there inherent dangers in technological advancement? Who is to blame when inventions are weaponized and used to cause harm? There is a lot of human alteration that happens in the future: genetic modifications, chip implants, memory recording, and more. All things which both the ostensible good guys and bad guys deploy rather cheaply.

And then there are the old time travel conundrums. Can the effects of the present change the future? Are there multiple timelines? Is everything unfolding according to some set plan? These questions are ones the show is conscious of and so far they've carefully avoided giving us any solid information. Some interesting ethical time travel issues are also raised. For example, what if making the future better prevents your loved ones from existing? What if protecting the future means letting people you care about in the present die? By the end of season one Cameron has only started to face such choices. She is going to be caught between protecting the future where her husband and son live or protecting present-day innocents. Not an easy call, though it is an interesting situation to put your characters in.

On top of all this there are plenty of mysteries and conspiracies to unravel, like the reason for Cameron's presence in 2012. Was her time traveling with the terrorists accidental or orchestrated? Are the entire events of the show the result of some grand plan?

At the end of the first season we learn that there are even more travelers who are acting independently. Some of which are there to "abuse the timeline" -- a fantastic sci-fi phrase -- while others are trying to protect it. How they will play into the central conflict has yet to be seen.

The show also uses the *Lost*-esque device of bookending episodes with flashbacks that reveal the pasts of the characters. (Technically the flashbacks go forward, but they are revealing the history of the characters before they traveled to 2012. Not the "current" and possibly altered future.) This approach is by no means original, but it does work well and I'm quite partial to it.

## The Bad

All that good sci-fi stuff may have made this sound like a great show, but it isn't. It's not horrible, but there are a lot of problems, most stemming from plot convenience.

The way the characters act, the technological "powers" available to them, and the consequences of failure are all heavily influenced by plot convenience. The plot demands that Cameron act a certain way in this situation, so she does. The plot demands that her futuristic catsuit malfunctions, so it does. Scientific jargon is used to drop in elements like mind control and near perfect crime scene recreation. But each is confined only to the one episode where it's used. Again, it's not horrible, but there are times where it feels too contrived. These are issues that plagued the earliest sci-fi series. Modern shows should know better.

The acting is also no where near the standard set by the best shows on television. It's probably the fault of the writing, but few characters are lovable.

Rachel Nichols as Cameron is okay, if inconsistent. She's much better than you'd expect from her previous roles. Here you can watch [Nichols in *G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra*](http://youtu.be/kcIMxpYolBY) delivering one of the worst lines I've seen in a film. "Emotions are not based in science. And if you can't quantify or prove something exists, well, in my mind, it doesn't." Oh, okay. Scarlett, the team scientist, doesn't think emotions *exist.* Why? Because that's what happens when hack Hollywood writers [try to imitate how they think intelligent people sound](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtheist). Anyway, you could be forgiven for hating her after seeing *G.I. Joe*, but she is much, much better in *Continuum*.

Cameron's 2012 cop partner, Carlos Fonnegra, is bland as toast. Young Alec Sadler is likable enough, except when the writers are portraying him as an angsty teen. Think John Connor from *The Sarah Connor Chronicles*. The most enjoyable character is Matthew Kellog, played by [Stephen Lobo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Lobo). Scenes featuring Kellog are my favorite. He reminds me of a [charming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zikt_DeCEyM), [cocky](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz0RbgZRGkE) Abed.

*Continuum* also appears to be a little unsure about the society it presents. There are a lot of vague references to the control of the corporations. And how power should be given back to the people; democracy should be restored. It sounds like a lot of pop social commentary and I'm not sure I trust the writers to have a deeper understanding of the social issues they're dealing with. Right now it serves the show by adding to its grayness, but in the long run I suspect it'll leave the series confused about its own message.

None of these things are the worst part of the show. The worst part is how often it plays like a procedural cop drama rather than science fiction. There are episodes that would be indistinguishable from shows like *CSI* or *Law & Order* if it wasn't for the occasional science jargon and technological deus ex machinas. I understand this is likely due to budgetary constraints but it is disappointing. The second season supposedly elevates the show. I hope that it ends up being a great sci-fi show that finds its feet as a mediocre cop drama, rather than just a cop show with sci-fi window dressing. 

## Worth Watching?

If you like sci-fi and time travel, then yes. You'll be annoyed at the plot contrivances, but as a sci-fi fan you're probably used to that at this point. And it is better than many others. The police procedural aspects will bore you the most, but there are episodes that break the mold and make it worth watching.

If you're not particularly interested in sci-fi and the types of issues I mentioned above, then no. You'll probably just see this as more generic TV that isn't worth investing time into.

For those of us already watching, the hope is that the show [grows its beard](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard) and finds some greatness.
