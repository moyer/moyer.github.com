Writing every day is harder than I thought, especially on the weekends. You can see "article creep" in my first few posts. They each became progressively longer and more like my idea of what an article should be. And along with the article creep comes more anxiety and stress about what I should write and if it will be good.

I consciously counter-balanced that by writing what is essentially a [link post on Friday](http://willmoyer.com/everyday/bbc-newsnight-greenwald/) and a tweet-sized [review of Gravity on Saturday](http://willmoyer.com/everyday/go-see-gravity/).

I almost missed Saturday entirely, which is why I'm considering taking the weekends off. I don't want this to become a hassle that I resent.

In the spirit of reducing resentment, I also don't have any strict rules. But I would like every post to be longer than a tweet but shorter than a thousand words. An average of three of four hundred would probably be best. I'm also fine with going back and updating or expanding on existing posts. As long as *something* goes up every day.

Anyway, here's to one successful week of writing every day.
