Watch this [BBC Newsnight interview of Glenn Greenwald](http://youtu.be/f1Zvo8N3G94) and be shocked and appalled at how Kirsty Wark, a supposed journalist, defends and protects the current political establishment while attacking Greenwald for exposing their crimes.

She says:
>It is very possible that you actually, by your actions, make it easier for terrorists to understand how to evade all the checks that are made on them online.

To which Glenn points out:
>The idea that terrorists didn't know that the United States and UK governments were trying to monitor their communications is laughable. Of course every terrorist who is capable of tying their own shoes has long known that the US and UK governments are trying to monitor their communications. The only thing we've informed people of is that the spying system is aimed at *them*.

Wark then asks (in direct contradiction to her earlier point that Glenn revealed the spying programs to terrorists):
>Do think it would be such a shock that spies actually do spy? Or do you think, actually, for a majority of the population, perhaps, it actually might be quite reassuring?

Glenn:
>I think it's a shock that government officials lie to the face of journalists who don't seem to mind very much.

Embarrassing. What else can you say?
