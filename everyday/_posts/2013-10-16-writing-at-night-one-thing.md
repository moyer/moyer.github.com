Doing it in an altered state is another. Turns out it's even harder. So here's another one of those posts where I'm just phoning it in and hoping we'll never speak of this again.

The idea is that everything I write on here that's decent will get saved or show up elsewhere and posts like this one will just fade from memory. The cream rises to the top… and the crap sinks to the bottom.
