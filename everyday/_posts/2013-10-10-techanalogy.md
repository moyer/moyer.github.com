More humans should treat everything the way they treat technology. I don't mean the young-person obsession with or the old-person fear of, I mean the average person's expectations. Our expectations of technology are vastly different than our expectations in other areas.

Now, to be clear, I'm talking about what people commonly think of as "technology," which is electronics. New devices. Computers, phones, tablets, music players, and all of the software that goes with them. I'm not using the broader definition of technology, "applied knowledge", which basically covers everything humans do. (And another reason we should have more consistent expectations.)

Here are a few examples, all of which should be contrasted with how we think about medicine, government, education, transportation, and a whole host of other human problems we're always struggling with.

## It Better Do Its Job

We aren't forgiving when it comes to technology. If a new device doesn't perform the way it's supposed to, the way it was advertised, then it's a piece of crap. There is much less room for error. And nobody is interested in any excuses.

When we discover bugs or broken functionality in software, we might keep using it -- if we have to -- but we're not happy about it.

We practically have a zero-tolerance policy for failure.

Yeah, if only U.S. foreign policy was *half* as effective as Siri.

## It Better Get Better

A year has gone by and your company hasn't released a newer, better, faster device? No. You released a new version of that application and you *didn't* fix the bugs? No. [Unacceptable](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8380562/gifs/adventure-time-lemongrab-unacceptable.gif).

Whatever it is you're making, it better get better. And fast. We're not waiting generations to see some improvement. We're not waiting a couple of years! Make it better, now.

Hell, not even better. We want a new invention, something we haven't seen before.

What? The American school system has pretty much been the same since 1910? It's still basically a bunch of kids in a room and a teacher with a textbook. That's fine. Let's add [Smart Boards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Board) and some standardized tests. That ought to cover it.

## It Better Be Cheap

We may recognize on some level that creating this device is the result of years of research and work by thousands of people. People who are likely spread all across the globe, working for different organizations, doing science and design and manufacturing and shipping. But it better be cheap. How cheap? More cheap. Always more cheap.

So what if a team of developers and designers spent a year crafting this beautiful app? If it costs more than 99 cents you can suck it.

What? An MRI costs $3000? I guess that's okay. We all have insurance, anyway.

## Who Cares If The Problem Is Complex?

We're not particularly concerned with how complex the problem is.

We want a device that has access to all of the world's knowledge, stored on decentralized servers, with endless redundancy, interlinked with millions of other data sources and we want all the data to be transmitted invisibly over the air no matter where we are. And it should fit in our pocket and never need to be charged.

*Oh is that a problem for you?*

Photoshop CS6 is the most advanced consumer image manipulation tool and programmers had to write over 4.5 million lines of code to make it work. But it still doesn't make my blurry camera-phone night photos look better soâ€¦ not impressed.

## It Better Be Easy

Either there's a team of engineers thinking about to make this product the most easy and delightful experience for us or we're not interested. Nobody is paying to jump through hoops.

If your website doesn't hook me in the first few seconds, peace.

Imagine how crazy it would be if I had to fill out an online form, print it, mail it to the DMV, wait for them to mail me an appointment card, then wait in line for two hours to have a new drivers' license picture taken? That would never happen.

## We Want The Impossible

For the record, some of our expectations when it comes to technology might be a tad unreasonable. To some degree, we do want the impossible. But there are benefits to that unreasonableness. It puts pressure on the people solving the problems. It puts pressure on us, to do better, to not settle.

If only we weren't so used to settling when it comes to everything else.
