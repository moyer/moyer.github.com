title: How To Not Impress The TSA

I'm writing this post while flying on a plane. It's my first time using internet on a plane and even though nothing about it is revolutionary on a technical level, it feels really impressive and wild on a psychological level. I love when technology gives you that "this is too good to be true" feeling.

Anyway, I rarely tell personal stories, but I have good one from right before I boarded this flight.

TSA held me while going through security. The guy monitoring the carry-on baggage scanner stopped my luggage while it was on the conveyor and called a couple of other agents over. Then he called a couple more agents over.

Immediately, I started going through the possibilities of what could be happening. I had a plastic version of [Finn's sword from Adventure Time](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Finn) -- it's part of my Halloween costume -- that might have looked weird on a scanner. A couple years ago, my friend [Casey](https://twitter.com/ceasaigh) gave me a [Pen Type-A](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cwandt/pen-type-a-a-minimal-pen). The Pen Type-A is basically a steel cylinder inside a steel rectangle. It always makes me nervous going through security with it. And I thought maybe this was the time it would finally get confiscated. Or maybe there was some illicit substance -- "obviously something I was just holding for a friend, officer" -- left in a pants or jacket pocket.

That's why I was pretty shocked when a large, military-looking agent asked me, "are there any weapons in here you want to tell me about?"

"Uh no?" *Unless he's talking about a plastic sword.*

It wasn't a plastic sword. It was something pretty shocking.

The TSA agents had found a clip of .45 caliber [Black Talon rounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Talon) inside the lining of my luggage. Yeah.

Turns out my dad -- a former NYC detective with a carry permit -- had used my luggage on a trip years ago and -- in some sort of ex-cop mentality -- stashed a loaded clip in the lining.

Pretty sure this is the type of thing you can go to jail for. Or at least end up on some threat list. But that didn't happen. At least not the first one.

Needless to say, the TSA wasn't happy about it. But relative to my expectations of airport security, it wasn't that bad. They searched my bags, asked me a bunch of questions about who I was and what I was doing, ran my passport and drivers license, and obviously confiscated the ammo. The whole thing was over in under twenty minutes.
