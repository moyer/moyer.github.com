There is a debate in Québec over a proposed bill called [The Québec Charter of Values](http://cl.ly/3a0j1i080u2F). One provision of the bill is to limit and restrict what clothing state personnel can wear, specifically religious symbols.

Last Thursday, Toula Foscolos wrote [a piece for HuffPo](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/toula-foscolos/quebec-charter-janettes_b_4115601.html) criticizing a group of prominent Québec women who support the bill. In it, she said:

> Feminism is first and foremost about choice. The choice to live free of religion. The choice to live *with* religion. … What diminishes Quebec women's emancipation is a Charter that aims to prevent veiled women from working in hospitals and schools! Such a restrictive step backwards devalues everything the feminist movement in this province has worked so hard for: the choice for women to do as they please.

I completely agree with her about how ridiculous it is to ban and restrict what a woman can wear and then call it equality or liberation. How is using the political system to restrict what a woman can do any better than a religion or culture restricting what a woman can do? Enforcing what a woman should do or what a woman should be is the very problem. Not to mention the absurd treat-the-symptoms approach of banning religious symbols. As if that solves any of the underlying problems.

But I disagree with her here:

> You don't get to treat a woman who made a different choice from you as "crazy" and "manipulated."

Yes, you do. You get to criticize or judge whoever you want. What she is implying is that all choices are equal, just different. They're not. There are bad choices, crazy choices, ignorant choices, and harmful choices. And we should judge them.

None of that means treating people like they are less than human. Or attempting to restrict their choices or force yours onto them.

And if your criticism of someone is simply that they are "different" or "weird" or "foreign", then yes, you're being ignorant and intolerant. But it's not because you criticized, it's because you criticized for bad reasons. In the same way that choices are not all equal, neither is criticism. There is bad criticism, crazy criticism, ignorant criticism, and harmful criticism. Criticism and judgements are just as subject to criticism and judgements as anything else. As [John Siracusa points out](http://arstechnica.com/staff/2009/05/hypercritical/), it's a recursive process.

Can't Foscolos very argument that you shouldn't judge another woman's choices be used against her? *The Janettes made a choice to write that letter. Just because what they think is different from what you think, just because their choice is different from your choice, doesn't mean you get to treat them as if they are ignorant, intolerant, and bigoted.* Obviously, she wouldn't agree. Foscolos assumes, correctly, that she has every right to treat the choices of the Janettes however she wants. And her judgements will either be valid or invalid, accurate or inaccurate.

Even she doesn't actually buy into the idea that a "different" choice is somehow above criticism or judgement.
