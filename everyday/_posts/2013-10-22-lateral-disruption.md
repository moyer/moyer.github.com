During today's [Apple event](http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/22/4866718/ipad-air-to-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know-apple-fall-event), developer Sara Chipps tweeted: "Our kids are definitely going to laugh at the fact that we found a way to connect humanity and used it to look at text, colors, & pictures."

To which another developer, Daniel Erickson, responded: "That seems to be a pattern. Do some trivial thing that changes the world. Ask ourselves why. Then use it for meaningful things."

This exchange got me thinking about the idea of disruption. Maybe there are some human patterns of behavior or thought that are too entrenched to be directly challenged, especially when the tools or technology that would make challenging them more easy doesn't yet exist.

Instead, new tools and technologies are developed and used for a seemingly innocuous, non-threatening (to the established systems) purpose. Then, once the tools are integrated into people's lives, they can make a lateral movement and disrupt entrenched patterns.

Think of how many times some new invention began as a novelty or gimmick only to eventually creep into our lives and become a necessity, all the while displacing the old way of doing things. That's lateral disruption.
