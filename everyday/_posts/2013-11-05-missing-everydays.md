I missed about seven days worth of posts. Once I started traveling again it was easy to lost track of time or forget to post or just be too busy. Not to mention that after I missed one day it became easier and easier to miss more. It reminded me of skipping classes in college. Once your perfect record is broken, who cares?

Anyway, I want to continue but I don't want this to become an obligation or something I feel guilty about not doing. I would like to continue posting regularly, though. We'll see what happens over the next couple weeks.
