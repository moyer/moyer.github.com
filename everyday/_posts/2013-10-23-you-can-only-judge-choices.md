title: You Can Only Judge Choices

As a follow up to [my post from a few days ago](http://www.moyer.com/everyday/toula-foscolos-and-the-janettes/): It's even more ridiculous that Toula Foscolos would attempt to argue that you shouldn't judge someone else's choices, because choices are the only thing you *can* judge.

Things that aren't a choice -- like race, ethnicity, geographic region of birth, gender, sexual orientation, etc -- are the things that shouldn't be judged. How can you judge someone for something outside of their control?

You can't criticize a person for being born into a Muslim family, but you can absolutely judge them for choosing to become Muslim. The world would be a better place if less people were judged for things they didn't choose and more were judged for what they did choose.
