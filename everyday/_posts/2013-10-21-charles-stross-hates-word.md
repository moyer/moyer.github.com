Science fiction writer [Charles Stross describing why he hates Microsoft Word](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html):

> Microsoft Word is a tyrant of the imagination, a petty, unimaginative, inconsistent dictator that is ill-suited to any creative writer's use. Worse: it is a near-monopolist, dominating the word processing field. Its pervasive near-monopoly status has brainwashed software developers to such an extent that few can imagine a word processing tool that exists as anything other than as a shallow imitation of the Redmond Behemoth.

Pretty standard feelings when it comes to Word. But he goes on to explain Word's history and why it was broken from the very beginning:

> Steve Jobs approached Bill Gates to write applications for the new Macintosh system in 1984, and Bill agreed. One of his first jobs was to organize the first true WYSIWYG word processor for a personal computer -- Microsoft Word for Macintosh. Arguments raged internally: should it use control codes, or hierarchical style sheets? In the end, the decree went out: Word should implement both formatting paradigms. Even though they're fundamentally incompatible and you can get into a horrible mess by applying simple character formatting to a style-driven document, or vice versa. Word was in fact broken by design, from the outset -- and it only got worse from there.

This is one of the reasons -- previously unknown to me -- why Word suffers so horribly from the [overlapping instructions problem](http://writingfortheweb.co/sample/).

The rest of the post hits on the common problems with Word: its bloated be-all-things-to-all-people approach; its convoluted interface; its garbage, proprietary, indecipherable file format; its terrible typsetting; and its nearly non-existent collaboration options.

I consider this post to be the "modern" equivalent to Allin Cottrell 1999 classic: [Word Processors: Stupid and Inefficient](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html).
