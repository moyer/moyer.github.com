There's a lot wrong with the US political system. But since returning to the US a little over a month ago, I keep thinking about one aspect: how it lowers the expectations of the American population.

It's good to have goals for society, to have ideas about how humans should behave. Society improves because people have causes and ideas they believe in, that they think will make our lives better. We benefit from those who are willing to lower their shoulders and push the rest of humanity forward.

But the political theater that's on constant blast in the US reveals something very odd. Apparently, most people's goals for society are "pretty much how it is now but with just this one thing kind of tweaked."

In fact, if your goals are even a little bit larger than that they will be dismissed as idealist and utopian. Any goals that alter the political or social structure in a significant way are labeled "extreme."

The two-party structure heavily promotes this thinking. Once you buy into it you must constantly concede any principled or long-term goals for tiny short-term gains. And the political and media spheres only amplify this by treating every minor issue as if it's the greatest battle between good and evil there has ever been. If you oppose *this* policy, you hate poor and sick people. If you oppose *that* policy, you'll be aiding the terrorists. Oh and by the way, this upcoming election is the *absolute most important one in history*.

The Republicans are crazy, right-wing fascist nut jobs and the Democrats are weak, socialists who want to destroy America.

Anyone with knowledge of political philosophy recognizes that the Republicans and Democrats are about a hair's width apart on any rational political spectrum. But it doesn't matter, because the citizenry has had its expectations bottomed out.

As a result the American population, exhausted and cynical, values and praises anybody who can accomplish the smallest of political victories, even if it comes with a host of other costs. And since everyone grows up being taught that politics is the primary mechanism for social change, they slowly start to think only in the smallest of goals. Anyone who thinks outside that narrow range of "what is possible given the current political climate" is a radical who couldn't possible hope to affect real change. They start to think of the [status quo as a given](http://willmoyer.com/rape-and-pragmatism/).

And once you've accepted that, you're goals inevitably reduce themselves to "the status quo plus one."
