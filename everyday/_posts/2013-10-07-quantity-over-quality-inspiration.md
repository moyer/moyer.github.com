title: Quantity Over Quality Inspiration

In honor of Monday, here are two of my favorite videos for inspiring quantity over quality. It's hard to stop worrying about how your work isn't good enough and just produce more of it, but these videos help. They always remind me that the only to get to quality is *through* quantity.

First, [Ira Glass on storytelling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI23U7U2aUY&feature=youtu.be):

> The most important possible thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. â€¦ It's only by actually going through a volume of work that you're actually going to catch up and close that gap. And the work you're making will be as good as your ambitions.

And [Ze Frank's An Invocation for Beginnings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYlCVwxoL_g):

> Perfectionism may look good in his shiny shoes but he's a little bit of an asshole and no one invites him to their pool parties.

Those are just my favorite quotes from each. They are both worth watching in full.
