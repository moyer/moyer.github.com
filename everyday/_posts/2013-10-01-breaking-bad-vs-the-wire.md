Now that *Breaking Bad* has sadly but satisfyingly come to an end, TV nerds everywhere must face the ultimate question: "How does *Breaking Bad* compare to *The Wire*?"

Even my parents, who are much closer to average TV viewers than nerds, raised the question when I told them *Breaking Bad* was one of the best shows ever. "But wait," said my dad, "do you think it's better than *The Wire*?"

How can you answer that? It's complicated. While there may not be an answer, it is worth comparing them.

I can say this: *Breaking Bad* is probably the best conventional television series ever made. Yes, conventional. It's about a main character who enters a new situation and must adapt to it. He pays prices, he learns lessons, he changes, and eventually reaches some final conclusion. It's a tragedy, where the protagonist is undone by his own mistakes or ambitions or flaws. It's one of the most conventional arcs in storytelling. *Breaking Bad* just *seems* unconventional because it's so good. Its characters are real, its pacing confident, and its plotting logical and dramatic. It's an amazing character study of Walter White, with more depth than any other similar show.

*The Wire*, on the other hand, is probably the most unconventional -- while still being good -- live-action series of all time. Who are its protagonists? Or its antagonists? McNulty may be an audience hook in the beginning, but he's not the protagonist. The most sensible answer is that Baltimore itself is the protagonist. *The Wire* is about systems and institutions. While the pawns moving on the chessboard may have arcs, the larger story is a study of society. It doesn't do cliffhangers or conventional drama. It does the slow, miserable inevitability of human systems. It's an examination of the war on drugs, on schools, poverty, police, politics, and media. While it's deconstructing our beliefs about these institutions it also deconstructs our very ideas about what a story is supposed to be. And it does it while having realistic characters caught in interesting situations. *That* is why *The Wire* is so beloved.

*Breaking Bad* is one of our oldest human stories, told at it's absolute finest. *The Wire* is a new story, told well. *Breaking Bad* has more consistent quality throughout, but *The Wire* is more consistently challenging to us throughout. *The Wire* has weak seasons (especially the fifth), but *Breaking Bad* isn't as ambitious.

To claim the throne of the *the best show ever*, we need something with the scope and ambition of *The Wire*, but with the consistency and depth of *Breaking Bad*. Impossible? Maybe. It would certainly be a [dream come true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9I0W1930FE).
